[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Mean weight for first babies is 7.201, compared with other babies' mean weight of 7.326, and so first babies tend to be slightly lighter than others. 
>> The Cohen's d between first babies' weight and others' weight is -0.0887, showing that there's not a large difference between first or other babies' weight (). When compared with the different in pregancy length (Cohen d = 0.0289), weight has a slightly larger effect.
